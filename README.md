# Yassine — Full Stack Developer Portfolio

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio: a modern, fast, and minimal website to present my skills, projects, and experience as a full stack engineer.

It is designed to highlight strong backend foundations (Java/Spring, .NET Core), solid frontend work (Angular, React), and real-world experience with deployment, DevOps, and production-ready architectures.

## About

I build complete solutions from idea to deployment:

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cloud), .NET Core / ASP.NET, REST APIs, authentication & authorization, clean architecture.
- **Frontend:** Angular, React, TypeScript, responsive UI, reusable components, dashboard-style interfaces.
- **DevOps & Deployment:** IIS, Nginx/Apache, Docker, CI/CD, reverse proxies, SSL, production monitoring.
- **Databases:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, query optimization, migrations.
- **Collaboration:** Git/GitHub workflows, code reviews, branching strategies, documentation.

This portfolio is both a showcase and a playground for the technologies I use in real projects.
