# Portfolio — Full-Stack Engineer Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio: an interactive, story-driven experience that showcases how I build **reliable, production-grade systems** that connect code, infrastructure, and real-world operations.

The UI is designed as a narrative:

> From bringing industrial networks and weighbridge systems online to deploying modern web platforms and APIs — every section reflects how I approach systems: **observability, robustness, and clarity**.

## Highlights

- Story-driven **About** section connecting:
  - On-site deployments
  - Networking & industrial integration
  - Modern full-stack engineering.
- **Projects** presented as interactive “control panels” with tech stack & impact.
